# Bundesliga-simulation

Warning: I know, the code is quite messy.
It works but is uncommented and needs to be reworked. At first it was just for me and not meant to be published.  

An early Matlab Code to simulate results of a German Bundesliga season (or any other sports championship in which points are earned). 

Attack strength and defense strength of the teams can be adjusted.
The purpose of the simulation was to find out what the result of a Bundesliga season would look like if all teams were equally strong. 
For this purpose, a large number of complete seasons are played through. Each game is simulated individually. 
The number of goals per game and team is assumed to be Poisson distributed.
